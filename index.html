    <h2>Brife Bio</h2>
   <p>Tewodros Kassahun Germamo (Amharic: ቴዎድሮስ ካሳሁን ገርማሞ; born 14 July 1976), known professionally as Teddy Afro, is an Ethiopian singer-songwriter. Known by his revolutionary songs and political dissent sentiment, Teddy is considered one of the most significant Ethiopian artists of all time.[1] Teddy has had a huge cultural impact on the Ethiopian music industry and has been a big influence on many young artists.</p>

 <p>Teddy Afro made his debut in 2001 with the album Abugida, quickly establishing himself as a prominent voice in his native country. Mixing reggae, traditional Ethiopian styles, and pop music, his sophomore LP, 2005's Yastesereyal yielded a major hit in its controversial title track, which criticized corruption in the country's government. The song "Hab Dahlak" talks about the division of Ethiopia and Eritrea in terms of couples separating. Four of the album's songs were subsequently banned from media outlets, though "Yastesereyal" sales and influence remained controversial.

    His second album Teddy was done in 2000 but released in 2002.
    
    His third album, Yasteseryal was released in 2005. This album was one of the most influential and controversial. Teddy's lyrical sentiments and the release of this album coincided with the elevated political tension in Ethiopia surrounding the 2005 Ethiopian general election. The government banned four of his songs including "Yasteseryal" from playing on Ethiopian media outlets.[3] Nonetheless, the album sold more than a million copies within a few months after its release.[4]</p>

       <p>After his breakthrough, Teddy released his fourth album, Tikur Sew on 14 April 2012. The album Tikur Sew (black person) is dedicated to Emperor Menelik II and the Battle of Adwa, the war of colonial resistance between the Ethiopian forces and the Italian Empire in 1896. The album was the most expensive and most widely sold album in Ethiopia after his fifth album Ethiopia. The album saw huge sales via music markets. According to AdikaRecords' producer Ashenafi Zeleke, the music markets required 500,000 CDs and 200,000 cassettes and the album was in process for sale.[5]
